\subsection{Advancements in Emotion Recognition}
Advancements in deep learning and artificial neural networks are expected to contribute to more sophisticated emotion recognition models. 
Deep neural networks can learn complex representations and hierarchies of features, enabling the detection of subtle emotional cues and nuanced emotional states. 
The integration of deep learning with multimodal data analysis holds the potential to achieve even higher levels of accuracy and granularity in emotion recognition.
