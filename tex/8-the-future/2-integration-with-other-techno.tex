\subsection{Integration with Other Technologies}

Affective computing is likely to integrate with other emerging technologies, opening up new possibilities for human-computer interaction. 
For example, the integration of affective computing with augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) 
can create immersive environments where users can engage with emotionally responsive virtual agents or experience personalized emotional narratives.

Additionally, the integration of affective computing with natural language processing (NLP) can enable more natural and emotionally intelligent conversational agents. 
These agents can not only understand the semantic content of user input but also interpret and respond to the emotional nuances embedded in language, 
leading to more authentic and engaging interactions.
