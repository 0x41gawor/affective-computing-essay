\subsection{Deep Learning}

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has shown remarkable success in affective computing tasks. 
Deep neural networks can automatically learn intricate representations and relationships within data, leading to improved emotion recognition accuracy.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used architectures for analyzing visual and temporal data, respectively, in affective computing.
Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in emotion recognition from images, videos, and physiological signals.
