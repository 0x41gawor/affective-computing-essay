\subsection{Reinforcement Learning}

Reinforcement learning techniques have gained attention in affective computing to enable systems to adapt and respond to users' emotions in real-time. 
By incorporating reinforcement learning, affective systems can learn optimal strategies for interacting with users based on their emotional feedback.
 These systems can dynamically adjust their behavior, providing appropriate responses and interventions to maximize user satisfaction and well-being.
