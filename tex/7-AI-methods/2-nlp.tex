\subsection{Natural Language Processing (NLP)}

NLP techniques are utilized in affective computing to analyze textual data, such as social media posts, reviews, or chat transcripts,
 to understand and infer emotional states. Sentiment analysis, a subfield of NLP, is particularly useful in determining the polarity and intensity of emotions expressed in text. 
NLP methods help uncover valuable insights about users' emotions, opinions, and sentiments, contributing to personalized user experiences and targeted interventions.
