\subsection{Computer Vision}

Computer vision techniques are integral to affective computing, particularly in analyzing facial expressions and body language to recognize emotions. 
These techniques involve the extraction of facial features, such as eyebrow position, mouth shape, or eye movements, and mapping them to specific emotional states.
 Facial expression recognition algorithms, such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), 
enable the detection and interpretation of subtle changes in facial expressions, providing insights into users' emotional experiences.
