\subsection{Customer Experience}
Emotion recognition systems can analyze customer emotions in real-time, enabling businesses to tailor their offerings, 
personalize interactions, and improve customer satisfaction. Emotion-aware chatbots and virtual assistants can provide empathetic and contextually appropriate responses, 
enhancing the overall customer experience. 
For example, in call centers, sentiment analysis techniques can be applied to analyze customer interactions and provide real-time feedback to customer service representatives, 
allowing them to adjust their approach based on customers' emotional states.
Emotion detection in retail environments can help businesses assess customers' reactions to products and store layouts, optimizing the shopping experience and product placement.
