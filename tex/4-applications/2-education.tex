\subsection{Education and Learning}
In the field of education, affective computing offers opportunities for personalized and adaptive learning. 
Emotion-aware educational software can adapt instructional strategies based on students' emotional responses, enhancing engagement and learning outcomes. 
Emotion recognition systems can also aid in assessing students' affective states, providing insights into their learning experiences and addressing emotional barriers to learning. 
For instance, intelligent tutoring systems can adapt their feedback and guidance based on students' emotional states, helping them stay motivated and engaged. 
Emotion-aware virtual reality environments can simulate real-world scenarios to evoke specific emotional responses and facilitate experiential learning.
