\subsection{Healthcare}
Affective computing finds applications in healthcare, where emotion recognition and analysis can contribute to patient monitoring, mental health assessment, and emotional well-being. 
Emotion-aware systems can assist in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders, enable empathetic interactions between healthcare providers and patients, 
and provide personalized interventions based on emotional states. For example, emotion recognition technology can be utilized to assess pain levels in patients who are unable to 
express themselves verbally, such as infants or individuals with cognitive impairments.
