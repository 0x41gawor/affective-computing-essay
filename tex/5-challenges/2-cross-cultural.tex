\subsection{Cross-Cultural and Individual Differences}
\subsubsection{Cross-Cultural Variations in Emotional Expressions}
As it was mentioned in section \ref{sec:cross-cultural-variations} emotional expressions can vary across cultures, influenced by societal norms, values, and display rules.
Computing systems must account for these cross-cultural variations to avoid biases and ensure accurate interpretation of emotions. 
Developing culturally sensitive models and datasets that encompass a diverse range of cultural backgrounds is essential to address this challenge.
\subsubsection{Individual Differences in Emotional Responses}
As it was mentioned in section \ref{sec:Individual-differences} emotional responses can vary significantly among individuals due to personality traits, past experiences, 
and psychological factors. Affective computing systems must consider these individual differences to provide personalized and contextually appropriate responses.
 Developing models and algorithms that can adapt to individual emotional profiles and dynamically adjust system behavior is a critical challenge.
