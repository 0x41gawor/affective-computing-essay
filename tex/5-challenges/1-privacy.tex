\subsection{Privacy and Ethical Considerations}
\subsubsection{Data Privacy and Security}
Affective computing systems often rely on collecting and analyzing personal data. 
Ensuring the privacy and security of this sensitive information is of paramount importance. 
Researchers and practitioners must implement robust data protection measures, such as encryption, secure storage, and anonymization techniques, to safeguard users' privacy.
\subsubsection{Informed Consent and User Awareness}
Ethical considerations arise regarding obtaining informed consent from users for data collection and processing in affective computing applications. 
Users should be made aware of the purpose, scope, and potential implications of emotion data collection.
Clear and transparent communication regarding data usage and user control over their data is crucial to maintain trust and respect user autonomy.
