\subsection{Emotion recognition techniques}
To integrate emotions into computing systems, researchers have developed various techniques for recognizing and interpreting human emotions. 
These techniques range from facial expression analysis and vocal tone analysis to physiological measurements and natural language processing.

\subsubsection{The basic emotions}
Before diving into the topic of recognition, first let's define what we can recognize. In the book "Emotional Intelligence" by Daniel Goleman,
he identifies several basic emotions that are universally experienced by individuals across different cultures.
These basic emotions include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Happiness: Happiness is a positive emotional state characterized by feelings of joy, contentment, and satisfaction.
    It is associated with positive experiences, achievements, and pleasant circumstances.
    \item Sadness: Sadness is a negative emotional state typically associated with feelings of sorrow, grief, and melancholy. 
    It often arises in response to loss, disappointment, or separation from loved ones.
    \item Anger: Anger is a powerful and intense emotion characterized by feelings of displeasure, frustration, and hostility.
    It arises in response to perceived injustices, threats, or frustrations.
    \item Fear: Fear is an emotional response to perceived danger or threat. It triggers a heightened state of alertness and prepares the body for fight, flight, or freeze responses. 
    Fear can stem from actual physical danger or from psychological or social factors.
    \item Disgust: Disgust is an emotion that arises in response to offensive or repulsive stimuli. 
    It is associated with feelings of aversion, revulsion, and the desire to avoid or reject something distasteful.
    \item Surprise: Surprise is an emotion experienced when something unexpected or unfamiliar occurs. 
    It is characterized by a brief state of astonishment or wonder, often accompanied by physiological reactions like widened eyes or an open mouth.
    \item Contempt: Contempt is an emotion that involves feelings of scorn, disrespect, or superiority toward someone or something considered inferior or unworthy.
    It often arises from a sense of moral or social superiority.
\end{enumerate}

While these emotions are considered foundational, it is important to note that the emotional landscape is rich and nuanced, and individuals can experience
a broad spectrum of emotions that go beyond these basic categories. 
Additionally, it is worth noting that from the definition of emotion, we can often discern observable traits that are common among individuals, aiding us in identifying specific emotions.
For instance, surprise is commonly recognized by the presence of an open mouth.
